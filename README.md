Utilizing AI/ML to analyze customer data and develop strategies to improve member retention rates in banking services

In the competitive landscape of the banking industry, customer retention is paramount. 
With customers having multiple options for financial services, banks must focus on not just attracting new customers but also retaining existing ones.

# Proposed Solution
1. We have customer churn data which comprises of a number of attributes.
2. Applying two Models on the Data:\
	a.  Segmentation Model (K means Clustering)\
	b.  Classification Model (Random Forest)
3. Segmentation Model : Segments the customer into specific Segment (Standard , Moderate, Special) according to its feature.
4. Classification Model : Classifies the customer into Retained or Not Retained Categories.
5. Not Retained customers are suggested with retention strategies based on  their segment , impacting data and bank services using LLM(Large Language Model).
